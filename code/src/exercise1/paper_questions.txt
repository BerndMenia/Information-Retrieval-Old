1) What is the goal of this paper?
Exploring new techniques for efficient evaluation of phrase queries
Generally phrase queries are performed by creating an inverted index of the available documents and then query those inverted indexes.


2) How do the authors reach their goal?
The authors have already proposed another solution to this problem by using nextword indices. Using them can speed up queries a lot, but the indexes are twice as large as conventional inverted one and therefore not suitable for all use cases. However making use of a combination of nextword indices and inverted indices phrase querying is twice as fast, but the overhead is only 10%.


3) How do they evaluate their approach?
